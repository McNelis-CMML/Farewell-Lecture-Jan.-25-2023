Apologia7.pdf is the set of slides from my Farewell Lecture at Fordham on Jan. 25,2023.  I use the word "apologia" in the spirit of John Henry Newman's book, "Apologia pro Vita Sua".
Apologia is not an "apology" but an "apolegetics" for giving oneself to a life of research and teaching in the field of Macroeconomics.  The video of the presentation, with introudction by Jamres
R. Lothian, is also in this repository.  You can watch it, about 90 minutes, by clicking on the side link.
